# Introduction
Weratedogs data wrangling project for the data analytics nanodegree on Udacity. Data wrangling is the process of removing errors and combining complex data sets to make them more accessible and easier to analyze.

## The Process
- ### Gather

    3 datasets were gathered throught 3 different formats (CSV, TSV and JSON) using the pandas, requests and json libraries

-  ### Assess

    Data assessment was done both visually and pragmatically. The aim of this process is to check for tidiness and quality issues in the data
- ### Clean
    Cleaning the data is usually the most important and longest step of data wrangling. This step getting rid of all issues discovered during the previous step

## Analysis
The following insights were uncovered during the analysis of the data:
1. Over the years, the folllowers count for weratedogs has reduced.
2. Golden retriever is the most common dog breed
3. Charlie is the most common dog name
4. Puppo is the most common dog stage

## Conclusion
Data wrangling is an iterative process and could be done as many times as possible. Further analysis could be performed on the data to gain more insights.
